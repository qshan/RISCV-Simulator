# RISCV-Simulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/skyzh/RISCV-Simulator.svg?branch=pipeline)](https://travis-ci.com/skyzh/RISCV-Simulator)

RISCV-Simulator implemented in C++. Support RV32I ISA.

This branch simulates a pipelined RISC-V CPU.

## Why Functional?

Personally I would like to implement a simulator which reflects the 
hardware design as closely as possible. Inspired by CSAPP HCL (some 
examples below), I make one constraint in my implementation, therefore accomplishing this goal.

```
int dstE = [ 
    icode in { IRRMOVL } : rB; 
    icode in { IIRMOVL, IOPL} : rB; 
    icode in { IPUSHL, IPOPL, ICALL, IRET } : RESP; 
     : RNONE; # Donâ€™t write any register 
];
```

### There is no feed forward of data

Contrary to CSAPP HCL, where we cannot read back data, there's no 
feed forward of data in my implementation.

Data in circuit depends on other data in the circuit. Initial register state
and contents in the memory determine the outcome. Therefore pipeline status
can be updated by obtaining the next PC.

```cpp
    PC.write(w->get("w_pc"));
```

There are only two exceptions. In write back stage, registers
should be updated no matter whether its value is required. The
same applies to memory access stage.

Then we can update register clock, and process the next cycle.

### Therefore, it's functional

The process described above resembles lazy evaluation of a function
in Haskell. It can be easily expressed in a functional way. In this
project, `Stage` object saves all such functions, hence an intermediate
value won't be evaluated twice in a single cycle.

### But, it's slow

It's slow to resolve dependency in functional programming style. Therefore,
I manually resolve dependency and use feed-forward flavor in this branch.
For example, in `Session.cpp`

```cpp
    w->hook(); // Write back
    m->hook(); // Memory access
    e->hook(); // Execute
    d->hook(); // Decode
    f->hook(); // Fetch
```

In decode stage, we should check if any source register will be written in the
following stages. Therefore, we must obtain circuit parameters of write back
and memory access stage before obtaining decode information. In this way,
we can make the simulator run faster.

## Tips

* Register x0 is always zero.
* Be careful with branch jump. Make sure you know next instruction is relative to PC or the next.
* You should write return address to rd when executing jal.
* When I was debugging, I printed out PC at every moment to check branching functionality.
* And I made a trap at 0x1000 then print register a0 to know what printInt was exactly printing.
* When debugging pipeline, I print out PC in every stage.
* If you don't want to disassemble the binary, you may just print necessary information to identify the instruction.
  For example, just identify an instruction as "r-r operation" instead of "add", "sub", etc.
* You may write your own test case in assembly with [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).
  Then dump memory in hex format, load it into simulator and test it. Some examples in tests/ folder.
