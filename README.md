# RISCV-Simulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/skyzh/RISCV-Simulator.svg?branch=feedforward)](https://travis-ci.com/skyzh/RISCV-Simulator)

RISCV-Simulator implemented in C++. Support RV32I ISA.

This branch simulates a sequential RISC-V CPU.

To reduce running time, this branch is implemented in a feed forward flavor.
